https://fast-thicket-69779.herokuapp.com/

## Overview
The Date Nights App was created by Meredith Bashert and Justin Warren as a part of General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Program.  The app allows a user to keep track of the movies they would like to watch for upcoming date nights.  The home page displays all user entries, with the ability to edit/delete entries.  In addition to this, users are able to search for movies using the OMBD database(http://www.omdbapi.com/) as the core API.

## Approach Taken
In the initial planning stages of the project, various tasks were assigned with Meredith managing the front-end development(React.js, JSX, CSS) and Justin managing the back-end development (PHP, Postgres, SQL).  After creating the initial MVP(Minimum Viable Product), each team member contributed to the further development of the full-stack application.  The final product was deployed to Heroku.
